[pdf version](http://qiuyoungwang.github.io/files/CV_wqy.pdf)

Education
======
* **M.S.** in Applied Math, Columbia University in the city of New York, 2021-2023 (expected)
* **B.S.** in Chemistry (Honors degree), Wuhan University, 2017-2021 (overall GPA: 3.81/4.0)
* Visiting student in Columbia College, Columbia University in the city of New York, 2020

Research experience
======

* **Coarse-grained method for PDEs of Integrate-and-Fire neural network**

* Advisor: Jiwei Zhang    School of Math and Statistics, Wuhan University

* 2020.9-2021.5 : Research Assistant

* Duties included:

  * Mechanically studied a new coarse-grained framework to solve the Integrate-and-Fire (IF) network based on PDEs to avoid *the curse of dimensionality*

  * Rebuilt and improved a spatially ordered spiking neural network (SNN) model that matches the experimental result about neural variability.

  * Modelled the CaMKII pathway in neurons with kinetic equations to show its on/off property in LTP.

    

* **Place cells generation via auto-encoder model with a strong history effect**

* Advisor: Stefano Fusi     Centre of Theoretical Neuroscience, Columbia University

* 2020.5- 2020.9: Research Assistant

* Duties included: 

  * Simulated the memory performance of a Hopfield network with cascade synapses model to solve the *catastrophic forgetting* problem.

  * Built an auto-encoder model which can naturally generate place cells in hippocampus, and implemented the cascade synapses model above to strengthen the history effect.

    

* **A novel antimicrobial treatment and a non-systematic drug delivery method**

* Advisor: Xianzheng Zhang.    College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University

* 2018.6 - 2019.6 : Research Assistant

* Duties included:

  * Developed a novel anti-bacterial method combining photodynamic therapy and chimeric peptides, which was published in *Jounral of Materials Chemistry B*. [see here](https://qiuyoungwang.github.io/files/BMP_paper.pdf)
  * Tested the idea about non-systematic drug delivery strategy to central neural system through axoplasmic transport.
