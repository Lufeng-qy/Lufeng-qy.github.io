Education
======
* B.S. in Chemistry (Honors degree), Wuhan University, 2017-2021 (overall GPA: 3.80/4.0)
* Visiting student in Columbia College, Columbia University in the city of New York, 2020

Research experience
======

* 2019.9 - 2020.3, 2020.9-now : Research Assistant
  * School of Math and Statistics, Wuhan University
  * Advisor: Jiwei Zhang
  * Duties included: 
    * Mechanically studied a new coarse-graining framework partitioned ensemble average (PEA) to integrate-and-fire network with multiple-firing events to avoid the *curse of dimensionality*
    * Rebuilt and improved a spatially ordered spiking neural network (SNN) model that matches the experimental result about neural correlation and attention
    * Combined the PEA with spatially ordered SNN above to further simulate place cells in hippocampus and implement large scale simulation about V1 (ongoing project)
  
* 2020.5- 2020.9: Research Assistant
  * Centre of theoretical neuroscience, Columbia University
  * Advisor: Stefano Fusi
  * Duties included: 
    * Simulated the memory performance of a Hopfield network with complex synapses model to solve the *catastrophic forgetting* problem
    * Built an auto-encoder model which can naturally generate place cells in hippocampus, and implemented the complex synapses model above to strengthen the history effect
    * Mechanically studied the concept cells and its generation through auto-encoder model, which regarded concept cells as place cells in feature space
  
* 2018.6 - 2019.6 : Research Assistant
  * College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University
  * Advisor:  Xianzheng Zhang
  * Duties included:
    * Developed a novel anti-bacterial method combining photodynamic therapy and chimeric peptides, which was published in *Jounral of Materials Chemistry B* [see here](https://qiuyoungwang.github.io/files/BMP_paper.pdf)
    * Research about a novel drug delivery strategy across the bloodâ€“brain barrier to central neural system through axoplasmic transport
