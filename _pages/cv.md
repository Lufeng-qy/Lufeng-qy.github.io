Education
======
* M.S. in Applied Math, Columbia University in the city of New York, 2021-2022 (expected)
* B.S. in Chemistry (Honors degree), Wuhan University, 2017-2021 (overall GPA: 3.80/4.0)
* Visiting student in Columbia College, Columbia University in the city of New York, 2020

Research experience
======

* 2019.9 - 2020.3, 2020.9-2021.5 : Research Assistant
  * School of Math and Statistics, Wuhan University
  * Advisor: Jiwei Zhang
  * Duties included: 
    * Mechanically studied a new coarse-graining framework for integrate-and-fire (IF) network to reduce the dimensionality.
    * Rebuilt and improved a spatially ordered spiking neural network (SNN) model that matches the experimental result about neural variability.
    * Combining the coarse-graining method and spatially ordered SNN for larger-scale simulation (ongoing project).
  
* 2020.5- 2020.9: Research Assistant
  * Centre of theoretical neuroscience, Columbia University
  * Advisor: Stefano Fusi
  * Duties included: 
    * Simulated the memory performance of a Hopfield network with cascade synapses model to solve the *catastrophic forgetting* problem.
    * Built an auto-encoder model which can naturally generate place cells in hippocampus, and implemented the cascade synapses model above to strengthen the history effect.
  
* 2018.6 - 2019.6 : Research Assistant
  * College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University
  * Advisor:  Xianzheng Zhang
  * Duties included:
    * Developed a novel anti-bacterial method combining photodynamic therapy and chimeric peptides, which was published in *Jounral of Materials Chemistry B*. [see here](https://qiuyoungwang.github.io/files/BMP_paper.pdf)
    * Tested the idea about non-systematic drug delivery strategy to central neural system through axoplasmic transport.
