Education experience
======
* B.S. in Chemistry, Wuhan University, 2017-2021 (GPA: 3.78)
* Visiting student in Columbia College, Columbia University in the city of New York, 2020
* Minor in Computer Science, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 2019-2020

Currently, I'm an undergraduate in Wuhan University, China. But I'll start my education experience from an early age.

I have been interested in biology since I was in junior high school, when my biology teacher start my enlightenment. After entering senior high school, I start studyling national biology competion, where I learned a lot about biology course in university(such as biochemistry, genetics, cell biology) , but failed to get the First Prize.

When choosing my major after the national college entrance exam, I choose chemistry since I would like to learn more in biology, and chemistry is the fundation of it somwhow. However, the reality never goes well, and traditional biology/chemistry is not as charming as it looks. I start doing research about biomaterials for medical use since I ended my fresh-man year, and start to feel sick about it after I realized I will never like wetlab. I found what I willing to do is theoretical things, and the wetlab full of repetitive work never fits me. 

Luckily, I got in touch with computational neuroscience by coincidence ( in Zhihu ), and I think this is what I would like to do.
