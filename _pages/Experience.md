## Coarse Grained method for IF network and Spatially Ordered Network

**Advisor: Jiwei Zhang     School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, China**

Integral-and-Fire(IF) neural network is a more biological neural network compared with the artificial neural network (ANN). It captures the key feature of neurons, namely spikes. However, it's really expansive to evolve this network because of the *curse of the dimensionality*. In ANN, the computation is quite fast, since the activation function is simple and the derivation is somehow trivial. In IF network however, we have to solve equation like this for each time step 

(the 2nd term in the right hand side repersents the total input, both from the background noise and other inputs from presynaptic neurons)

$$\frac{dV_i^Q}{dt} = -g_i(V_i^Q-V_L) + \sum_j\sum_k S^{QY}\delta(t - t_{jk}) $$

So is there any better method to solve the IF network? Well, yes! Take a simple all-to-all connected IF network for example. We do not care every neuron's voltage in each time step. Instead, we look for the probility distribution function(PDF) of voltage, or the mean firing rate $m(t)$ of the system. And the mean firing rate could be generated by the PDF. 

First, write down the master equation governing the evolution of PDF $\rho(v,t)$

$$\partial_t \rho^Q(v,t)=g_L\partial_v[(v-V_L)\rho^Q(v,t)]+\eta^Q[\rho^Q(v-S^{QY},t)-\rho^Q(v,t)]$$

To make it more clear, we transform this equation into the Fokker-Planck equation:

$$\partial_t \rho^Q(v,t)+g_L\partial_vJ^Q(\rho^Q(v,t))=0$$

Using boundary conditions, the firing rate $m^Q(t)$ could be written as:

$$m^Q(v,t)=g_LJ^Q(\rho^Q(v,t)) = -\frac{g_L\sigma^2}{2}\partial_v \rho^Q(V_T, t)$$

However, the get the firing rate $m(t)$, we have to solve the PDE, which is not easy. Thus, we try to transform the PDE into a sery of ODEs by introducing the moments:

$$M^Q_j(t)=\int^{V_T}_{-\infty}v^j\rho^Q(v,t)dv$$

Then, the higher order moment could be calculated via lower order moments:

$$\frac{dM^Q_j(t)}{dt}=-m^Q(t)V_T^j-jg_L[M^Q_j-\mu^QM^Q_{j-1}-\frac{j-1}{2}(\sigma^Q)^2M^Q_{j-2}]$$

However, to evolve such an ODEs system with given initial conditions $M(t_0),m(t_0)$, we need to compute $m(t)$ at each time step, which inquires computing $\rho(v,t)$. 

Instead of computing $\rho(v,t)$ directly (which needs solving PDE), we introduce the maximum entropy method by approximating the PDF $\rho(v,t)$ with the equilibruim solution $\rho_{eq}$

$$\rho_{eq}^Q=C\exp(-\frac{(v-\mu^Q)^2}{(\sigma^Q)^2})\int^{(V_T-\mu^Q)/\sigma^Q}_{(v-\mu^Q)/\sigma^Q}e^{s^2}ds$$

$$\rho_{me}(v)=\rho_{eq}(v)\exp(\sum_{j=0}^N\lambda_jv^j-1)$$

Above all, we could get the firing rate of a IF network by simply dealing with the ODEs system. This method is both fast and accurate. And with more moments introduced, the result becomes more accurate.

I also built a spatially ordered IF network for further analysis.(The method discussed above is for all-to-all network. For spatial order, however, we need to do some modification.)



## More biological hippocampus model via cascade synapses

**Advisor: Stefano Fusi      Centre of Theoretical Neuroscience, Columbia University, U.S.** 

"Your past shapes your future". This most philosophical quote describes the importance of hippocampus. Yet many myteries reamains unsolved in this old, paleomammalian structure, place cells is one of the most attractive features for me.

Active when an animal enters a particular place in the environment, place cells play an important role in navigation. In this paper, Benna et al. suggests the place cells are not just memory cells, instead, they might be a natrual result of supervised learning if hippocampus could be considered as a sparse Auto-Encoder(AE). However, the place cells generated by the AE model have relatively weak history effects, which means a memory will fade away quickly. 

This contradiction may be caused by the synapse model in AE, which is simple and has no memory effect. Thus, we introduce the cascade synapse model in this paper(Benna Fusi 2016), which is designed to avoid the *catastrophic forgetting*. A classic cascade synapse is made by a number of connected variables. The first variably $u_1$ is the synapse weight, while others are just hidden variables. And the learning preocess only influence $u_1$, and hidden variables $u_2, u_3,\cdots$ could conserve the old memories.

<p><center><img src="http://qiuyoungwang.github.io/images/projects/fusi_1.png" alt="Fusi_1" style="zoom: 50%" ></center></p>

The cascade synapse model has been tested on the Hopfield network. Here, we introduce this synapse model into a more realistic learning model, namely AE. We could see that the memory capacity strongly increases with the cascade synapse model.

As for place cells, we could see that place cells generated by AE with cascade synapse has a strong histroy model, which is quite close to the biological reality. (The y-axis here represents the error of recalling old memories, and the x-axis could be viewed as the time after inputing a new memory)

Above all, we have shown that power of cascade synapse in avoiding the *catastrophic forgetting*. And a more biological hippocampus model could be built with such a synapse model.




## CaMKII Pathway Model for LTP (Part of the Bachelor Degree Thesis)  

**Advisor: Shengli Chen     College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University, China**

Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is believed to be a general rule in human learning. Basically, *neurons fire together, wire together*. The change of the synaptic weight is related to the time interval between pre and post synaptic spikes. However, it remains unclear how neurons can generate such a behavior. And important molecular in such a physiological process is CaMKII, which is generall considered as bistable switch molecular in LTP. Here the CaMKII pathway is shown below. 

Note that CaMKII can phosphorylate itself. So when the concentration is high, it could be quickly activated. (To simplify our system, we assume that when $[CaMKII]$ go beyond a threshold, the self-phosphorylation starts)

<p><center><img src="http://qiuyoungwang.github.io/images/projects/shengli_1.png" alt="shengli_1" style="zoom: 30%" ></center></p>

And we model the interaction (or chemical reaction) of different molecular with the kinetic equations since most of them are enzyme catalysis:

$$V_0 = V_{max}\frac{[S]}{K_M + [S]}$$

Or more specifically, take the interaction between PKA and cAMP as an example:

$$\frac{d[PKA]}{dt} = k_{phos}[cAMP]^4\frac{[PKA]_0-[PKA]}{K_{f} +[PKA]_0-[PKA] } - k_{deph}[PKA]\frac{[PKA]}{K_{b}+[PKA]}$$

We could see that CaMKII act as an molecular switch in such an network. When input is low, the CaMKII will remain at a low state, while when the input is high, CaMKII phosphorylate itself when the concentration is high, thus remain at a high state

<p><center><img src="http://qiuyoungwang.github.io/images/projects/shengli_2.png" alt="shengli_2" style="zoom: 30%" ></center></p>

Yet CaMKII here is not strictly bistable, since the concentration of activated CaMKII could be of various of values, the ability of phosphorylate itself could result in bistable behavior in the downstream reaction. And example is CREB, which could lead to LTP when activated. CREB could be a downstream molecular in CaMKII pathway, which can be bistable as a result.

<p><center><img src="http://qiuyoungwang.github.io/images/projects/shengli_3.png" alt="shengli_3" style="zoom: 30%" ></center></p>

Above all, we modeled the CaMKII pathway, and showed that CaMKII could be a molecular switch in LTP.

Well, this project is about chemistry and materials (literally *cooking*). So I'll talk about them later...
