### Hi all, welcome to my personal website!

### I'm Qiuyang Wang(*王秋阳*),  and people usually just call me 'Young'. Currently I'm an undergraduate in Wuhan University, China.

### I'm strongly interested in computational neuroscience, where math, neurobiology and computer science meet together. My major is chemistry,  and I've done lots of coursework on applied math, CS and neurobiology. My past experiences cross various fields, including dynamics about spiking network, hippocampus model, hypercolumns(in V1) simulation, and biomaterials development, which  give me a mixed background for computational neuroscience.

### Currently, my research interest is dynamics of spatially ordered SNN, synchronous firing in hippocampus, mechanism of epilepsy(bottom-up), and computational sociology.



Although this website is mainly for academic (where one could view my research experiences, projects and thoughts), you could find something else interesting here. More details for me lays in the part '*more about me*', which contains nothing but my personal interest and hobbies. I also post blogs from time to time in this website, a few of them may be about computational neuroscience, but most of them are about my personal life and novels. If you wanna contact me more personally, my Wechat ID is  *ninanjieshizi*.

<br />

### Well, enjoy your time in this website!
