### Hi all! Welcome to my personal website!

### I'm Qiuyang Wang (王秋阳),  and you can just call me 'Yang'. Currently I'm a master student majoring in applied math at Columbia University. I'm focusing on the visual model of Drosophila in Bionet lab now. Before that, I completed the bachelor degree of chemistry in Wuhan University, China. 

### Academically, I'm interested in computational neuroscience, especially the dynamical behaviors of neural circuits and  their relationship to functions& features of brain. During my undergrad period, I mainly studied PDEs in IF neural network, hippocampus models, and mechanisms of STDP. I also spent some time on biomaterials development in my sophomore's year. Details could be seen in the part 'project'.

### I love painting, harmonica and literatures/local religions/legends. I also write stories from time to time, but now I'm still practicing my English writing skills.

<br/>

Although this website is mainly for academic (where one could view my research experiences, projects and thoughts), you could find something else interesting here. More details for me lays in the part '*more about me*', which contains nothing but my personal interest and hobbies. I also post blogs from time to time in this website, most of them are about my personal life and some stories. To contact me personally, you can follow my instagram(@lufengcryptids) or email lufeng199908@gmail.com.

### Well, enjoy your time in this website!
