### Hi all! Welcome to my personal website!

### I'm Qiuyang Wang (王秋阳),  and you can just call me 'Yang'. Currently I'm a master student majoring applied math in APAM department, Columbia University. Before that, I completed the bachelor degree of chemistry in Wuhan University, China. 

### Academically, my research interest lays in computational neuroscience, where math, neurobiology and computer science meet together. When I was an undergrad, I mainly studied flow methods in IF neural network, hippocampus models, and mechanisms of STDP. I also spend some time on biomaterials development in my sophomore's year. Details could be seen in the part 'project'.

### I'm also a big fan of detective novels and puzzle solving games. One could see my thoughts about them in my blog~

Although this website is mainly for academic (where one could view my research experiences, projects and thoughts), you could find something else interesting here. More details for me lays in the part '*more about me*', which contains nothing but my personal interest and hobbies. I also post blogs from time to time in this website, a few of them may be about computational neuroscience, but most of them are about my personal life and novels (and most of them are written in Chinese, forgive my English writing skills!). If you wanna contact me more personally, my Wechat ID is  *ninanjieshizi*.



### Well, enjoy your time in this website!
