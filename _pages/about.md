### Hi all! Welcome to my personal website!

### I'm Qiuyang Wang (王秋阳),  and you can just call me 'Yang'. Currently I'm a graduate student in Columbia University for the master degree in applied math. Before that, I was an undergraduate in Wuhan University, China. 

### I'm strongly interested in computational neuroscience, where math, neurobiology and computer science meet together. I mojor in appied math,  and I've done lots of coursework on CS, neurobiology as well as chemistry (which is my undergrad major). My past experiences cross various fields, including spatially ordered spiking neural network, hippocampus model, population ensemble method in IF network  and biomaterials development, which  provide me with a mixed background for computational neuroscience.

### Currently, my research interest lays in emergent phenomena and coarse-graining  methods in  SNN, synchronous firing in hippocampus, and, just out of curiosity, sociology.

Although this website is mainly for academic (where one could view my research experiences, projects and thoughts), you could find something else interesting here. More details for me lays in the part '*more about me*', which contains nothing but my personal interest and hobbies. I also post blogs from time to time in this website, a few of them may be about computational neuroscience, but most of them are about my personal life and novels. If you wanna contact me more personally, my Wechat ID is  *ninanjieshizi*.



### Well, enjoy your time in this website!
