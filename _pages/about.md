### Hi all! Welcome to my personal website!

### I'm Qiuyang Wang (王秋阳),  and you can just call me 'Yang'. Currently I'm a master student majoring in applied math at Columbia University. Before that, I completed the bachelor degree of chemistry in Wuhan University, China. 

### Academically, I'm interested in computational neuroscience, especially the dynamical behaviors of neural circuits and  their relationship to functions& features of brain. During my undergrad period, I mainly studied PDEs in IF neural network, hippocampus models, and mechanisms of STDP. I also spent some time on biomaterials development in my sophomore's year. Details could be seen in the part 'project'.

### I also love detective novels, harmonica and writing stories (they are usually not well written so I don't want to call them 'novels')

<br/>

Although this website is mainly for academic (where one could view my research experiences, projects and thoughts), you could find something else interesting here. More details for me lays in the part '*more about me*', which contains nothing but my personal interest and hobbies. I also post blogs from time to time in this website, most of them are about my personal life and some stories (and most of them are written in Chinese, forgive my English writing skills!). To contact me personally, please email lufeng199908@gmail.com.



### Well, enjoy your time in this website!
