Hi all, welcome to my personal website!

I'm Qiuyang Wang(*王秋阳*),  and people usually just call me 'Young'. Currently I'm an undergraduate in Wuhan University, China.

I'm strongly interested in computational neuroscience, where math, neurobiology and computer science meet together. My major is chemistry,  and I minor in computer science in HUST(Huazhong University of Science and Technology). I also have experiences in applied math in my junior year. These experiences give me a mixed background for computational neuroscience. Currently, my interest in this field is memory models, dynamic systems of neural networks and numerical approximation of integrate-and-fire(IF) networks.

Although this website is mainly for academic (where one could view my research experiences, projects and thoughts), you could find something else interesting here. More details for me lays in the part '*more about me*', which contains nothing but my personal interest and hobbies. I also post blogs from time to time in this website, a few of them may be about computational neuroscience, most of them are about my interest and daily life. One thing I have to mention is that most of my blogs are written in Chinese due to my mother language. However, I'm trying to translate some of them to practice my English writing skills. If you wanna contact me more personally, my Wechat ID is  *ninanjieshizi*.

Well, enjoy your time in this website!
