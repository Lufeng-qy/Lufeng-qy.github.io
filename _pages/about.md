### Hi all! Welcome to my personal website!

### I'm Qiuyang Wang (王秋阳),  or you can just call me 'Yang'. I just completed my master's degree in applied mathematics at Columbia University, where I worked in [Bionet](http://www.bionet.ee.columbia.edu) lab focusing on visual models of *Drosophila*. Before that, I completed the bachelor degree in chemistry at Wuhan University, China. 

### Academically, I'm interested in computational/theoretical neuroscience, especially the kinetic theories of neural population, the dynamics of neural circuits, and their relationship to functions& features of brain. My current research is mainly about the relationship between microvilli population dynamic and the phototransduction process in the fruit flies' retina. I'm also involved in the integration of retina model with other visual neuropils (e.g. lamina, amacrine cells layer) based on [Neurokernel](http://neurokernel.github.io).  

### During my undergrad period, I mainly studied kinetic PDEs for Integral-and-Fire neural networks, hippocampus models, and synaptic plasticity mechanisms. I also spent some time on biomaterials development in my sophomore's year. Details could be seen in the part 'project'.

### I love painting, harmonica and literatures/local religions/legends. I also write stories/blogs/novels from time to time, but the quality is usually not guaranteed.

<br/>

Although this website is mainly for academic (where one could view my research experiences, projects and thoughts), you could find something else interesting here. The part '*more about me*' contains nothing but my personal interest and hobbies. I also post blogs from time to time in this website, most of which are about my personal life and stories. To contact me personally, you can follow my instagram(@lufengcryptids) or email lufeng199908@gmail.com.

### Well, enjoy your time in this website!
