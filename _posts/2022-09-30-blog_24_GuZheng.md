> Only few people know I play GuZheng. And usually when I mentioned that to others , they always stared at me with an extremely shocked expression, as if I was confessing a murder. And usually they would ask, 'are you still playing that now?' My answer is a clear NO.

To those who don't know what is a GuZheng(*古筝*), it is a traditional Chinese instrument, kinda like guitar but in a more classic and oriental style.

And of course you cannot play GuZheng like a guitar since it's just so large(although that's one of my crazy irreverent thoughts...). But technically speaking, they are quite similar if you consider how they make sound: strings and a hollow body amplifying the signal. I do not want to be a engineer so the discussion of sound mechanism shall end here. 

As I said, you may wondering why people are always surprised that I play Guzheng. For most Chinese, it's a GIRL INSTRUMENT. Like in history, many dudes played that, and it was considered as a symbol of well-educationed and 'upper' class . But in modern days, most dudes don't play it anymore, and it eventually becomes a girls' thing. So the conversation basically went like this:

> A random guy: Are Qiuyang doing some after-school classes(*补习班*)(usually for schoolwork) right now？
>
> My mom: Nope we've never done that, but he's learning Guzheng these days
>
> That Guy: Wow! A boy learning Guzheng! That's pretty rare and unique! He must be super determined/deligent/some random good words (but those words are wierd...like I'm not going to be a musician, so playing Guzheng should be out of passion rather than be treated as a TASK or extra schoolwork)
>
> Me: (happy, at least it's a praise)



Now I can explain why I don't play that stupid thing: I, SIMPLY, DO, NOT, LIKE, IT! Yeah that's the truth. From the start I don't like it at all! At beginning it's just about curiosity, but later on, the so-called praises and my parents expectation are the only things supporting me. No one really asked my whether I like it or not. Although quitting is totally fine, I never thought of that (and for a primary school kid in a small typical Chinese town, you should behave like a WELL-BEHAVED BOY). It gradually became a task for me that have to be fulfilled. For an amateur player, there is a ladder to climb. There are 10 levels, and I ended up in level 8. I mean, if you are a musical student, that ladder is simply a joke. But for me, level 8 is not bad. 



The reason why I stopped climbing that stupid ladder is not because I finally found my missing courage to quit, but I went to middle school where studying is more important(in primary school, I'm a wild kid). My father said my Guzheng experience was a FAILURE(maybe in the tone of Steven He it would be hilarious), but my mom thought it was ok. Fortunately I love my middle school, it's a new-built school with so many activities. It even has a mandatory swimming class! I played with robots(unfortunately the LEGO one), I did plant cultiovation(tissue culture!), I have a microsope allowing me to do some 'experiments', and I wanted to be a director and a biologist at that time. GuZheng is finally gone, and I'm happy. 

(a sad story is happy time doesn't last long, I got fucked up in my high school, and maybe in Wuhan University as well...)



So why I'm telling the story here? Several days ago a phd student complaint to me that he was seriously considering quitting, and asked me what I would do in that situation. I said I would simply quit and go to industry, I wouldn't give a shit about the stupid academia if it does nothing good to me but only makes me super depressed. He said 'are you ok with that?'

'I'm totally OK doing that if I have to', I replied. 

Actually I have done similar things before. In most cases, Chinese college wouldn't let you change your major. So after I realized I don't like chemistry and found neuroscience and math charming, I felt I'm going to die there. So I just quit. Although my BS degree is still in chemistry, I'm now in an applied math program learning both pure and applied math, and doing research in neuroscience. Chemistry looks like a old dream to me now. My PTSD is kinda cured. 



I mean, the world is vast. If something makes you unhappy and there is nothing you can do about it, just quit. Do what makes you  happy, and you will be happy, or at least not depressed. Life is not fulfilling a task, doing meanlingless rat racing or climbling the 10-level GuZheng ladder. If you find what you want to do, then just do it. Sometimes you have to do what you don't really like, but  just don't be too obsessed with it. If I ended up in industry, I'll still play harps in the subway station in nyc, go to multi-faith gathering and mass(I'm by no means a christian tho) every week, write my own bible and the ultimate version of creepy old dude story came to my mind last night when watching *phantom of the oprea*.

That's what my long-unplayed GuZheng told me every time I thought of it. 



Last night, I asked my friend seriously, 'Will you look down upon me if I finally do financal math and work in the Wall Street?'

She replied, 'No, cuz I know you are not that kind of guy that will lose his soul '

I felt quite happy and relieved, and had a really really calming sleep.
