This is the so-called *project* in MATH4081 Differential Manifold by Prof. Dusa McDuff in Columbia. It's literally a 2-3 pages work containing basic definition, sketch of proof and some examples. It's not a higher level math course so we don't need to dive too deep. Still, I'm quite satisfied with this work and I would like to post it, which makes me end up being here. Again, it's quite basic and might be too trivial to you if you are a junior or higher student in a math department.
