> I replayed **Disco Elysium** for the second run recently. It's one of the best games I ever played, more like a literature than a video game, or a spiritual drug or alcohol.(Now my top3 game list are Hollow Knight, Disco Elysium, Detention(返校)). And I enjoyed it in English version, which somehow means, my reading skills is indeed getting better. Anyway, I'm writing some of my messy thoughts about it. (or in a fancy name called stream of consciousness)

Disco Elysium is a cRPG, although I don't know what the hell it is, just some guys call it that way. Actually you can consider it as a novel, broken and thick, like russian literatures(I'm considering reading Brothers Karamarzov now). If you love reading and are a sensitive guy, then simply play it, you will love it. One reminder is the NS version sucks, because of the console porting issue. However, I still played it on switch, because laying on the bed is so suitable for a lazy guy like me.

Long story short, let's start my fragments of thoughts. The detials would go wrong, but it really really doesn't matter.

(And yes, there will be a lot of spoilers. If you hate spoilers, do not read it. For me, I'm a spoiler enjoyer. Like when reading a novel, I always can't help to read the ending first, even for detective novels!)

## Basic Setup

Harrier(Harry) Du Bios is the main character, a broken and pathetic officer, immersed in drugs and alcohol, divorced with his ex wife(in his dream, the \*ex-thing\*) and trapped in his mirage past. Somehow he forgot all his memory in the past(retrograde amnesia) at the beginning of the game, and we need to find what kind of detective he *is* in the gameplay (yea, how conventional). He came to Martinaise, Revachol to solve a murder case, which is merely a reason for him and his partener, Kim Kitsuragi, to be here. This is not a detective game, logic has nothing to play in this show, instead, try to be sensitive and emotional, read the wind, kneel to a broken glass and try opening an unopenable door. Otherwise, you will be disappointed when realizing how **simple** the case is. 

## Martinaise, and la Revachol

<p><center><img src="http://qiuyoungwang.github.io/images/blog21/massacre.jpeg" alt="1" style="zoom: 50%" ></center></p>

Martinaise is a suck place. The former glory is far gone, only remaining shabby collapsing building and ironic king statue charging headlong at the viod. Martinaise is in Jamrock, a district in Revachol, while Revachol is a country or a city state. The history goes like this (a mixture of Russia and eastern Europe): 

At the end of the kingdom era, the communists took over during the Revolution and hanged the king. However, terrified by the communes, the captical world, or the Coalition, invaded Revachol and killed the communists in turn. 

> The horizon was black with Coalition airships. Their petroleum rose to the sky and it looked like... like it *formed* the clouds. Storm clouds. When they started shelling it was... dark magic.                  -- the deserter

It became the zone of control after that, experiencing the economic boom in 30s and the recession nowadays. 

## Dolores Dei

<p><center><img src="http://qiuyoungwang.github.io/images/blog21/Dolores.jpeg" alt="1" style="zoom: 50%" ></center></p>

Dolores Dei is the most well-known and perhaps the greatest innocence. An innocence in the game is something like a great historical figure, usually greater than a usual king or queen. Loosely speaking, it is the history itself, a personified history. As for Dolores Dei, she is 'the innocence of humanlism, the internationalism and the welfare state, perhaps the most famous human being ever to have lived.' During her era, people finally cross the pale (will explain later, for now, you can think it as the ocean, while the continent in our real world, is called isola in the Disco world) and discovered the New New World, marking the beginning of the interisola communication or colonialization whatever you say.

She is also an supernatural(oh there are supernatural things all over the Disco world, perhaps supernatural is actually very natural) overapotheosized, non-human **thing** with glowing lungs. She was murdered by one of her secret service member, who thought she was inhuman, yelling 'we were supposed to come up with this ourselves!'.

As you may notice, Dolores Dei is the West(in our history). It's the history of the great geographical discovery and colonialization, exploring and exploiting, modernizing and massacre. She is an innocence but also be criticised as a *de facto* murder. 

Also, Dolores Dei is also the projection of Dora, Harry's ex-wife in the real world, since he has fucking forgotten what she looks like (plz see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0sgQ70n_Kk&list=PLZwvB9Md_8udSt0wr-BvJGQw92Tw1plm4&index=11)). Somehow Doroles Dei and Dora has something in common. They both give warmth and humanity to people (Harry), but also hurt them(Harry) deeply. So in his dream, you can shout at the Dolores Dei Dora, accusing her as a "Mass Murderer!!!"

## the Pale

<p><center><img src="http://qiuyoungwang.github.io/images/blog21/fucktheworld.jpeg" alt="1" style="zoom: 50%" ></center></p>

Just like our real world, the Disco world consists of continients of matters, called isolas, surrounded by a separetive tissue, called the pale. In other words, the world is a broken reality floated on the ocean of void. The whole world, by the modern knowlege, seems like a broken disco ball with a dark grey corona. 

> Pale covers 72% of the surface. There are grey flares and prominences, even arcs above entire isolas... The images are blurry, but if there was a sphere in there it certainly looks like it fractured a long time ago.     --Joyce Messier

The ocean in our world is merely water, but the pale is something supernatural(again, supernatural is quite natural in Disco world), is the opposite of reality, enemy of matter and life, achromatic, odourless, and featureless. 

Surprisingly, human can pass the pale. Although intraisola trip is even frequent nowadays, travelling or exposing in the pale, do harms to human being, perticularly the mental health. People gradually become insane after long exposure in the pale. The reality flow into the pale, yet the information is still remained there. Maybe the old truck lay driver is a perfect example. The concept of herself becomes blur, while the memory of others, even those have been buried in the dust of history, fulfills her brain. In the end, she quit concerning herself a long time ago. 

* A fun yet scary fact is the pale may also contain the information of future as well, as is shown in the moralist quest. 

* According to the Insulindian Phasmid, humans may be able to create the pale. Or perhaps the pale are created by human's consciousness.

* The existence of the pale indeed makes the Disco world more charming and philosophical. My favorite quote is the summarization of Dolores Dei era:

  > Après la vie, la mort, Après la mort, la vie encore. Après le monde, le gris. Après le gris, le monde encore.
  >
  > After life, death --after death, life again. After the isola, the pale -- after the pale, the isola again.

Unfortunately, it seems the pale keeps expanding, sallowing the reality with an unclear rate. An intuitive conclusion is the pale will finally cover everything, but people tend to ignore it since it's unpleasantly horrible. 

> An uproar of matter, darling, *rising* into the pale. Rolling. Evaporating even, a great vision. The area of transition between the world and the pale is called \*porch collapse\*.            --Jorce Messier

An even more horrible thing is although the pale is usually external of isola, there are some evidence showing the pale could form inside the isola, called isolary entroponetics. This is god damn true, since in the game we have detected the 2mm hole of reality in a Dolorian humanity church and maybe in the doomed commercial area as well.

## Hardcore and the Insulindian Phasmid

The world SUCKS, and seems to end sooner or later, yet we still have to carry on, put our pieces back and fuck the world or be fucked by the fucking world. Life always goes on whatever happens, so why not have some god damn fun? In this game, there are three moments I will never miss(i.e. if the check fails, I'll do the SL immediately)

1. Dancing HARDCORE TO THE MEGA with Kim in the shabby Dolorian church
2. Sensing the existence of Insulindian Phasmid and connecting to it
3. Not letting Kim get killed(actually seriously injured) in the tribunal

And the first two is about optimism. The third is simply because Kim is such a nice guy(and really have a sense of humor!)

<p><center><img src="http://qiuyoungwang.github.io/images/blog21/dead.jpeg" alt="1" style="zoom: 50%" ></center></p>

 Yes the church is abandoned long time ago, and there is a likely growing baby pale inside it, but why not open a nightclub with hardcore anodic music and dance? Dance to the mega. Dance with Kim's shit and Andre's clumsy move under CODE 31. Dance and break the limit to shiver under the collective consciousness of the Revachol. 

> I AM LA REVACHOLIERE
>
> I AM THE CITY
>
> I AM THE FRAGMENT OF THE WORLD SPIRIT, THE GENIUS LOCI OF REVACHOL
>
> MY HEART IS THE WIND CORRIDOR. THE BOTTOM OF MY AIR IS RED. I HAVE A HANDRUAND THOUSAND LUMINOUS OF ARMS. COME MORNING, I CARRY INDUSTRIAL DUST AND LET IT SETTLE ON TREE LEAVES. I SHAKE THE DUST FROM THOSE LEAVES AND ONTO YOUR COAT.               --Revachol, the city

And the world still has some surprises! Just like the Isulindian Phasmid, a giant phasmid hidden itself around the reeds and the human's MIND, Two old cryptozoologist couple have been chasing this phantom for almost their entire life, which begins at an obscure encounter when the wife's is a little kid. All failure and no evidence, letting the faith bleach and the restless grow. The luckiest thing is we can finally discover its existence and ever photo it, ever talk to it just like talking to a spiritual ghost. It's such a holy and religious moment that burns one's tears out. 

To be honest I think the Insulindian phasmid has some symbolic meaning in the game yet I cannot figure it out. But it basically goes like this: You live in a doomed world, everything inevitably turns into dust, goods things fades away. Your past is vague, only remaining extreme pain whenever you found a part of it. Your effort seems to be meaningless however you tried. You cannot stop the wind, although the thunderstorm is at the corner. Yet you are an illusive guy, fond of cryptids and casually set some traps. With all the thing, good and terrible happened, at the end of the very end, you hesitated for a second and turned around, then and only then, saw the giant 3 meters phantom phasmid emerging from the forest of reeds, and suddenly realized that it has been there all along. You just didn't notice it. You just weren't concious of its existence.

## Maybe this is the end

Yea now I'm a bit of tired. Maybe I have written enough words about it, although there are still so many things rigging in my mind(e.g. 'Welcome to Revachol', 'See you tomorrow', 'Now you mastered the alphabet'...). My language is kind of pale. I believe if you enjoyed this game, you will know what I mean, otherwise you won't get my point however hard I tried. My philosophy is always,  sense the world, not analyze the world; be a sensitve guy, not a dumb geek. 

So that's it. Drink a glass of Tequila Sunset and immersed in the endless long night, until the 'Sunrise Parabellum', until the 'UN JOUR JE SERAI DE RETOUR PRES DE TOI'. 

Have a good night :)
